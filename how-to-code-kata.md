# How to: Code Kata in 5 easy steps?

In order to have a good Code Kata session, first, you are going to need resources, schedule, and execute the plan. So, here is what I can do for you. I’ll try to put things in very simple steps;

**Step 1**: Followings are the resources required for the session;

1. **A meeting room**
   _This is where you will have the session. Pick a spacious place enough to have 10 +/- 2 people. Pick somewhere peaceful ‘coz the session gets a bit noisy._
2. **A whiteboard**
   _This is to note down the problem, any ideas, discussion during the session._
3. **A projector**
   _This is to show the IDE so that everybody can see what the pair programmers do with the problem._
4. **Just ONE laptop**
   _This is to do the programming._

**Step 2**: Pick an algorithm or a small problem.
Session is all about trying to write a program for an algorithm or trying to solve a problem by writing a program for it. Typically, Code Kata starts with [Convey’s Game of Life](http://thinkorthwim.com/2007/05/27/john-conway-talks-about-the-game-of-life/). See more games on [Cyber-Dojo.com](http://www.cyber-dojo.com)

**Step 3**: Pick 10 +/- 2 members.
Members include pair programmers, advisors, and the facilitator. Note that there has to be a sensei as well, and you can be that person. See [Roles in Code Kata](roles-in-code-katas.md) too.

**Step 4**: Schedule an appointment, invite to all with following details;

1. **When?**
   _At least 1w or 2w prior to Scheduled date._
2. **Whom?**
   _Members picked in Step 3._
3. **Date & Place?**
   _Scheduled date, time, duration, and the place picked in Step 1._
4. **Content?**
   _Problem, Roles and Rules in the session, and what to bring for the session._

The good part about this is; participants get little space to practice the algorithm and be prepared. We can synergize all these during the session. See [Rules in Code Kata](rules-in-code-kata.md) too.

**Step 5**: Happy pair programming!
