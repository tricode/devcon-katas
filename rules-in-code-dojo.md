# What Rules to follow in Code Dojo?

Try to keep the code dojo session as a social coding event. I didn’t find many rules, except followings;

1. There is no student in the session, everybody is leader.
2. Facilitator must arrange resources.
3. Sensei must find a problem to solve, an algorithm, for instance, John Conway’s Game of life.
4. Sensei circulates the problem among the rest (at least 1w prior).
5. Sensei asks questions, does not give answers but only guides through.
6. Sensei keeps track on pairing time (approx. 15min-20min).
7. Typist works with Guider when coding, Pair programmers do as advisors say.
8. All advisors must participate on the projected code, give ideas to pair programmers.
9. All advisors must have their turn in pair programming, coding, and help coding.
