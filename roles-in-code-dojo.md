# What are the Roles in Code Dojo?

These are the roles I have seen in Code Dojo;

**A facilitator**
Have to make sure resources (in [Step 1](how-to-code-dojo.md) are available and ready for the session, could be an advisor, but not the sensei.

**A sensei**
Doesn’t sit with advisors, guides the session like a scrum master ( **important!** there are no students in this session), timebox each pair programming session, to which pairs.

**Pair programmers**
Only 2 programmers, sharing the IDE. Once a pair spent timeboxed period, typist moves to Guider’s seat, and a new advisor becomes a Typist.

- Typist – The one who controls the IDE.
- Guider – The one who guides the typist.

**Advisors**
Observes the code, provide feedback, suggestions, comments, proposes the changes to do. Everyone gets to pair program at some point during the session.
